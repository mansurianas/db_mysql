# What is a VIEW?
A **VIEW** is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SELECT query. It does not store data itself; instead, it allows us to display filtered data from one or more tables.

## üéØ Example:
Suppose we have a `students` table:

| id | name  | course\_id |
| -- | ----- | ---------- |
| 1  | Anas  | 101        |
| 2  | Ravi  | 102        |
| 3  | Meena | 101        |


If we want to see only the students with course_id 101, we can create a VIEW:
```mysql
CREATE VIEW cs_students AS
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE course_id = 101;
```
Now, whenever we query:

```mysql
SELECT * FROM cs_students;
```
output will be :

```mysql
| id | name  | course\_id |
| -- | ----- | ---------- |
| 1  | Anas  | 101        |
| 3  | Meena | 101        |

```
This means that cs_students acts like a filtered table.

#### To Drop a VIEW:
If you want to remove the view, you can use:
```mysql
DROP VIEW cs_students;
```
### Simple and Complex VIEW
`Simple VIEW`: Created from a single table.
`Complex VIEW`: Created by joining two or more tables or using GROUP BY.

## What is an INDEX?
An INDEX is a shortcut, similar to the index page at the end of a book, which allows you to quickly navigate to a specific topic.

In SQL, an INDEX speeds up query performance.

 Example:
 
Consider the students table:
| id | name  |
| -- | ----- |
| 1  | Anas  |
| 2  | Ravi  |
| 3  | Meena |



If you search for name = 'Meena', SQL will check each row. However, if you create an index on the name column:
```mysql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON students(name);
```
The search will be faster because SQL can directly access "Meena" through the index.


### Drop an INDEX:
If you want to remove the index, you can use:

```sql


DROP INDEX idx_name ON students;
```
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

- SELECT operations become faster with an INDEX.
- However, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations may become slightly slower due to the overhead of maintaining the index.
- Do not create an index on every column; only create indexes on columns that are frequently searched.
