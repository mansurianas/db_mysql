#  Database Design Principles

## 💡 What is Database Design?

`Database design is the process of:`

- Organizing your data,

- Avoiding unnecessary duplication,

- Ensuring accurate relationships between data,

- Making storage and retrieval efficient.



##   Why Is Proper Design Important?

- ✅ Avoids data duplication

- ✅ Maintains data consistency

- ✅ Makes queries faster and reliable

- ✅ Helps scale your application

--- 


##  What is Normalization?

`Normalization is a technique to:`

- Break down a big table into smaller related tables,

- Remove redundant (duplicate) data,

- Ensure each piece of information is stored only once.

🔥 Problem Example (Unnormalized Table):
```mysql

| StudentID | Name | Course1   | Course2 |
| --------- | ---- | --------- | ------- |
| 101       | Anas | Math      | Physics |
| 102       | Zoya | Chemistry | Biology |

```

### 1. 1NF (First Normal Form)

`✅ Rule:`

- Every column should have atomic values (no multiple values in one column).

- No repeating groups (like Course1, Course2).




**🔧 Fixing the Problem:**

```mysql
| StudentID | Name | Course    |
| --------- | ---- | --------- |
| 101       | Anas | Math      |
| 101       | Anas | Physics   |
| 102       | Zoya | Chemistry |
| 102       | Zoya | Biology   |

```

 - Now each value is atomic, and no column is repeated.

`🎯 This is First Normal Form (1NF)`



## 2NF (Second Normal Form)

`✅ Rule:`

- Be in 1NF

- Remove Partial Dependency

**📌 What is Partial Dependency?**

- When a non-key column depends on only part of a composite primary key.


`🔥 Example Table (1NF but not 2NF):`

```mysql

| StudentID | Course    | StudentName |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 101       | Math      | Anas        |
| 101       | Physics   | Anas        |
| 102       | Chemistry | Zoya        |

```

`Here, (StudentID, Course) is the composite primary key. But StudentName depends only on StudentID → Partial dependency`




`🔧 Fixing It (2NF):`

**🗂 Students Table:**

```mysql


| StudentID | StudentName |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 101       | Anas        |
| 102       | Zoya        |
```

**🗂 Enrollments Table:**

```mysql

| StudentID | Course    |
| --------- | --------- |
| 101       | Math      |
| 101       | Physics   |
| 102       | Chemistry |
| 102       | Biology   |


```

`🎯 Now, no column depends on part of a composite key → This is 2NF`


## 3NF (Third Normal Form)


**✅ Rule:**

- Be in 2NF

- No Transitive Dependency
  

**📌 What is Transitive Dependency?**

- When a non-key column depends on another non-key column (indirectly on the key).


`🔥 Example (2NF but not 3NF):`

```mysql
| EmpID | EmpName | DeptID | DeptName |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| 1     | Anas    | 10     | HR       |
| 2     | Zoya    | 20     | Finance  |
```

- EmpID is the primary key

- DeptName depends on DeptID, not EmpID directly → Transitive Dependency ❌



**🔧 Fixing It (3NF):**


`🗂 Employee Table:`

```mysql


| EmpID | EmpName | DeptID |
| ----- | ------- | ------ |
| 1     | Anas    | 10     |
| 2     | Zoya    | 20     |
```


**🗂 Department Table:**
```mysql

| DeptID | DeptName |
| ------ | -------- |
| 10     | HR       |
| 20     | Finance  |
```


`🎯 Now no transitive dependency → This is 3NF`



### 🔁 Summary of Normal Forms



| Normal Form | What It Fixes                      | Rule in Simple Words                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1NF         | Multi-valued and repeating columns | Break data into atomic values           |
| 2NF         | Partial dependency                 | Every non-key should depend on full key |
| 3NF         | Transitive dependency              | Non-key depends only on primary key     |




## What is Denormalization?

`Denormalization = combining tables to reduce joins and make read queries faster.`

**🔥 Denormalized Table (Single Table):**
```mysql

| OrderID | CustomerName | ProductName | Quantity |
| ------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| 1       | Anas         | Laptop      | 2        |
| 2       | Zoya         | Phone       | 1        |

```

`👉 Faster read queries, but data is repeated and harder to update.`


### 🛠 When to Use Denormalization

- Reporting dashboards

- Real-time analytics

- You want fewer joins and faster reads

- You’re okay with redundancy


#### 📌 Key Differences: Normalization vs Denormalization


| Feature          | Normalization        | Denormalization                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Purpose          | Remove redundancy    | Improve performance             |
| Data storage     | Less                 | More (due to duplicates)        |
| Read performance | Slower (more joins)  | Faster (less joins)             |
| Write complexity | Simple               | Complex (update in many places) |
| Best for         | OLTP (banking, apps) | OLAP (reports, dashboards)      |
