 # What is a Database?
A Database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
It stores data in a structured way so that it can be used efficiently by applications or users.
means:

Database ek register hota hai jisme hum data achhe se arrange karke rakhte hain, taaki baad me usse jaldi search, update, ya delete kar sakein.
Jaise ek school ki notebook me students ke naam, roll no. likhe hote hain — waise hi database me data hota hai.

 
 ## Why do we use a Database?
To store large amounts of data efficiently.

To retrieve and modify data easily using queries.

To ensure data is not duplicated or lost.

To relate different types of data (like users and their orders).

To secure the data from unauthorized access.



## What is MySQL?
MySQL is an open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
It uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to perform operations like creating databases, inserting data, and retrieving results.

means : 
MySQL ek free (open-source) software hai jisse hum database create aur manage karte hain.
Isme data table ke format me hota hai (rows aur columns me).
Hum SQL naam ki language se isse control karte hain — jaise ki data dalna, nikalna, ya delete karna.


## Relational vs Non-Relational Database
### Relational Database (RDBMS)
A Relational Database stores data in tables consisting of rows and columns. Each table represents an entity (like users, products), and tables can be linked using keys (Primary Key and Foreign Key).

It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage data.

Features:
Structured and predefined schema.

Data is normalized (i.e., split into multiple related tables).

Uses JOINs to combine data from multiple tables.

Ensures data integrity with constraints.

Examples: MySQL,PostgreSQL,Oracle,Microsoft,SQL,Server

###  Non-Relational Database (NoSQL)
A Non-Relational Database stores data in a flexible format, often as key-value pairs, documents (JSON), graphs, or wide-columns.

There is no fixed schema, and data can vary from one document to another.

Features:
Schema-less or flexible schema.

Stores data as documents, key-values, etc.

Faster for large unstructured data and horizontal scaling.

Doesn’t support complex JOINs directly.








Examples:MongoDB (Document-based),Redis (Key-Value),Cassandra (Wide-column),Neo4j (Graph-based)
