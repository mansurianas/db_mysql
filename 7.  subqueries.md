# 📘 MySQL Subqueries Explained with Examples

## 📂 Sample Tables:

### 🧾 `students` Table:

| id | name   | age | course_id |
|----|--------|-----|-----------|
| 1  | Alice  | 22  | 101       |
| 2  | Bob    | 25  | 102       |
| 3  | David  | 20  | 101       |
| 4  | Sara   | 27  | 103       |

### 📘 `courses` Table:

| id  | course_name     | teacher |
|-----|------------------|---------|
| 101 | Computer Science | John    |
| 102 | HR               | Smith   |
| 103 | Marketing        | John    |

## 1️⃣ Subquery in SELECT Clause

**Query:** Show each student’s name and also average age of all students.
```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  (SELECT AVG(age) FROM students) AS avg_age
FROM students;
```

**Output:**

| name  | avg_age |
|-------|---------|
| Alice | 23.5    |
| Bob   | 23.5    |
| David | 23.5    |
| Sara  | 23.5    |

**Explanation:** Har row mein average age `23.5` aa rahi hai jo ki `(22+25+20+27)/4 = 23.5` hai.

---

## 2️⃣ Subquery in WHERE Clause

**Query:** Show students whose age is greater than average.
```sql
SELECT name FROM students 
WHERE age > (SELECT AVG(age) FROM students);
```

**Output:**

| name |
|------|
| Bob  |
| Sara |

**Explanation:** Sirf Bob (25) aur Sara (27) ki age average (23.5) se zyada hai.

---

## 3️⃣ Correlated Subquery

**Query:** Show students whose age is above the average age in their own course.
```sql
SELECT name 
FROM students s
WHERE age > (
  SELECT AVG(age) 
  FROM students 
  WHERE course_id = s.course_id
);
```

**Output:**

| name  |
|-------|
| Alice |
| Sara  |

**Explanation:**  
- Alice & David (course 101): Avg age = 21 → Alice > 21 ✅  
- Bob (course 102): Avg = 25 → not > 25 ❌  
- Sara (course 103): Alone, avg = 27 → edge case

---

## 4️⃣ Using EXISTS

**Query:** Show students enrolled in a course taught by John
```sql
SELECT name 
FROM students s
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT * 
  FROM courses c 
  WHERE c.teacher = 'John' AND c.id = s.course_id
);
```

**Output:**

| name  |
|-------|
| Alice |
| David |
| Sara  |

**Explanation:** Only those students whose course is taught by 'John' (101, 103) will be shown.

---

## 5️⃣ Using ANY

**Query:** Show students whose age is greater than anyone in HR course.
```sql
SELECT name 
FROM students 
WHERE age > ANY (
  SELECT age FROM students WHERE course_id = 102
);
```

**Output:**

| name  |
|-------|
| Alice |
| Sara  |

**Explanation:** HR course mein sirf Bob hai (age 25), toh koi bhi student jiska age > 25 ho, woh show hoga.

---

## 6️⃣ Using ALL

**Query:** Show students whose age is greater than everyone in HR course.
```sql
SELECT name 
FROM students 
WHERE age > ALL (
  SELECT age FROM students WHERE course_id = 102
);
```

**Output:**

| name  |
|-------|
| Sara  |

**Explanation:** Sara (27) hi woh student hai jiska age HR ke sabhi students (Bob - 25) se zyada hai.

## 🔹 1. Subquery in `SELECT` Clause

### Q1: Display each student’s name along with the total number of students.

```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students) AS total_students
FROM students;
```

`(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students): This is a subquery that returns the total number of rows in the students table, i.e., the total number of students.`

```
| name  | total\_students |
| ----- | --------------- |
| Alice | 4               |
| Bob   | 4               |

---

### Q2: Display each student's name and average age of all students enrolled in the same course.

FROM students s;
```
```mysql
| name  | avg\_age\_in\_course |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| Alice | 21.0                 |
| Bob   | 25.0                 |
